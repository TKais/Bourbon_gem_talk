Overview of the Gem

-Bourbon is a SASS mixin library.
  -SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets Sass) is a CSS extension language that lets you use features that don't yet exist in CSS, such as variables, nesting, mixins and inheritance. It offers object-oriented mechanisms that aren't available in CSS3. Basically, it's syntactic sugar for CSS.

-Bourbon eliminates vendor prefixes. Some are -webkit-(Android), -moz-(Firefox), and -ms- (Internet Explorer).

-Some sites that use it are Disney, Thoughtbot, and Breaking Bad's Danish site.
